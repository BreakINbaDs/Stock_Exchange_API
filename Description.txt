Stock Exchange API

To run the code you need to follow next steps:
  1) Make shure that you have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your PC.
  2) To make the API work you need to initialize database:
    - open terminal and run command "mongod" to run MongoDB server
    - in another terminal window run command "mongo" to open MongoDB shell
    - in mongo shell run "use stockDB" to create a database with the name 'stockDB'
    - then you need to initialize created DB with a "stocks" document, to do this
    run the next command:
    " db.stocks.insertMany([{countries: ["US","FR"], budget: 1, bId: 10, category: ["Automobile", "Finance"]},
    {countries: ["IN", "US"], budget: 2, bId: 30, category: ["Finance", "IT"]},
    {countries: ["US", "RU"], budget: 3, bId: 5, category: ["IT", "Automobile"]}]) "
  3) Then open one more terminal window and navigate to "./stock_exchange_api" directory.
  4) Run " npm install" and then "npm start" to start the server.
  5) Now you can access API
    Example: "localhost:3000/US&Automobile&10"

Current API was built according to "Exchange Internal Matching Logic" from the assignment
document. It consist of one GET method which takes 3 parameters: country, category and bId.
Get method is represented by list_result() function which implements Matching logic in four
steps, reporting logs after each step to the stockExchageDebug.log file and returning
appropriate responses to the client after finishing work.

Multiprocessing implemented during server initialization stage so there N workers listening
on chosen port for incoming clients' connections, where N is a number of CPU's cores.
